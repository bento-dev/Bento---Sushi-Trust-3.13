## The Bento-dev project in few words

Bento is an Ubuntu Openbox Remix easy to use, built with programs such as openbox-menu and obsession, and using a few components from the Lxde project, but unlike Lubuntu, not the whole Lxde desktop manager.
 
This allows having it look like a full fledged desktop but lighter, and easily modified. It comes with user applications for the everyday use such as Office, Multimedia, Internet, and additional tools for the more advanced users, such as htop, sdparm, hdparm, testdisk, lftp, lshw, foremostâ€¦
It is made easy for the end users looking for simplicity and it is also made easy for the advanced users who will come to install it to newcomer's machines, or tweak it to their like the way they enjoy best.
 
Bento Ubuntu Remix distributions can be installed to machines ranging from more or less 10 years old up to the most recent PC's, and the most recent PC's. Older computers should come with at least 768 MB RAM and a 1Ghz capable CPU, a graphic card good enough. For older machines, or computers with a Sis GPU or other low specs graphics, other distributions, such as antiX - http://antix.mepis.org/index.php?title=Main_Page should be considered.
 
This version provided here is built on Ubuntu Mini Remix 12.04, as LTS, so they will benefit of the (unofficial) support until 2017, time when the 12.04 won't be supported anymore.
