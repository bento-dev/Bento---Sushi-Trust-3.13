##The Bento-dev project in few words
The present project aims to gather developers interested in creating a gui software to ease the configuration of the different parts in an Openbox only desktop environment.

Bento is an Ubuntu Openbox Remix easy to use, built with programs allowing to make it look like a full fledged desktop, while lighter. It comes with the desired programs for the everyday use, Office, Multimedia, and Internet, and additional tools for the more advanced users.
