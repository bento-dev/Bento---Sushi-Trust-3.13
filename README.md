## The Bento-dev project in few words
Bento is an Ubuntu Openbox Remix easy to use, built with programs allowing to make it look like a full fledged desktop, while lighter. It comes with the desired programs for the everyday use, Office, Multimedia, and Internet, and additional tools for the more advanced users. 

It is made easy for the end users while lighter than other versions coming with a full fledged desktop, and it is also made easy for the advanced users who will come to install it to newcomer's machines. The reason is that Bento comes with a few handy tools which most end users won't ask for, but that the person who will perform installs and post installation fine-tuning for them should appreciate. Bento Ubuntu Remix distributions are meant for all sorts of users, and can be installed to machines ranging from more or less 10 years old computers with at least 768 MB  RAM and a 1 Ghz capable CPU and the most recent PC's. It could be installed on machines with lower capability but I don't advice it as it would be uncomfortable with perceptible lag between the user action and the machine reaction. 

The versions provided here are built on Ubuntu Mini Remix 12.04, as LTS, so they will benefit of the (unofficial) support until 2017, time when the 12.04 won't be supported anymore.
