## The Bento-dev project in few words

This is Bento : Ubuntu Openbox Remix.

The goal is to provide a GNU/Linux distribution built around the light Openbox window manager, in an environment fit for the non tech and the more advanced users. We want it to be easy to use and customize, and we work with the Ubuntu editions and focus on the LTS editions of Ubuntu as a basis, for the stability.

Openbox is provided with openbox-menu and obsession (a new little program forked from lxsession-logout).

## Requirements

- At least 768 MB of Ram;
- At least a 1GHz CPU;
- Most recent graphics cards and some older ones are supported.
