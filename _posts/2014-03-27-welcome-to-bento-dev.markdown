This is the place where we can share some news and other development informations.

We can use some code examples if needed, like in the folowing `python` joke example:

{% highlight python %}
class Bento():
    '''This example is realy useless :D'''

    def take(self):
        return 'Enjoy ;)'
{% endhighlight %}

we could also use [external link][extra_ref] if needed.
